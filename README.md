## Local Setup

To set up the project locally for development, ensure that Node.js v18 LTS or higher is installed, and follow these steps:

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
2. **Install the dependencies**: After cloning the repository, navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server**
